# Amazon-Product-Review-Analysis
This is a Portfolio for my DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project with Incubator Hub. A comprehensive Excel-based analytics project on Amazon product reviews, pricing, and discount trends, developed during my time at DSA Incubator.
The project utilized pivot tables, slicers, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards to uncover actionable insights on product performance, category trends, customer behavior, and revenue opportunities.
